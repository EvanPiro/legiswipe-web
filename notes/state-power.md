# State Power

Section 5 of the constitution states: 

"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators."

The senator is critical to protecting state power in that each states is allocated 2 senate seats. If these senate seats were deprecated and the house of representatives had sole control over legislation, the legislation would be under the control of the general population of the US and thus would disregard state considerations.
