# Bill Passing

A bill must pass both the house and senate, then presented to the president to sign.
If the president vetos the bill, it is sent back to the originating chamber and require 
a two thirds vote to bring it back to the other chamber for an additional two thirds votes.
If that vote succeeds, then the bill becomes law. 

If the president does not look at a bill within 10 days, then it becomes law.
